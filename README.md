# Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

This project uses clinical data and machine learning to predict the likelihood of a person having heart disease. The aim is to assist in early diagnosis using simple input features and a Logistic Regression model.

- Performance metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score, ROC-AUC
- Outlier detection using boxplots
- ROC Curve plotted for performance visualization
- Trained model exported as `.pkl` using `joblib`
- Predicted results converted into readable class labels
